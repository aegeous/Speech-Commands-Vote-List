# Voice-Commands

This project will serve to collect the most common speech recognition and voice commands. Each collision can be resolved by GitPoll.

Create an issue for each collision.
Vote on the issue by adding "+1" or "-1" as a comment, OR by accessing the GitPoll for each issue at:<br>
"http://poll.gitrun.com/auwsome/Voice-Commands/issues/" plus the issue number such as:<br>
http://poll.gitrun.com/auwsome/Voice-Commands/issues/1

Collaborators are able to pull requests back to the master branch. These include the collisions resolved through the top voted issues.

Finally, a consensus list of the most common speech recognition and voice commands will be available to add to your favorite application's configuration file(s). 

In the future, the file integration may be automated by a profile application that notifies users of new additions and allows acceptance or rejection of individual changes, along with subscription to indiviual forks or author collections. Custom selections of each command implementation will be allowed, so that if you want to use the consensus list with a few variations, it will be easy to maintain a personal command profile. Application usage and user data will be available for reference as well. This project could have much wider application as a model for consensus and custom settings integration.. for applications, OSs and even organizations.
